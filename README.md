# Metasound + Sequencer Test

Demo project that causes the following error when playing a MetaSound with Sequencer:

`Assertion failed: IsInGameThread() || IsInAudioThread()`

The project was created from the Games -> Blank template without Starter Content. I then added a Level Sequencer with an Audio track and used a simple Metasound.

Important: the project will play in the Editor Viewport or as Standlone Game. You must Package Project to see the error on boot!
